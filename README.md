# COD_Analysis
Third-Party Modules: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.

## File Structure
### Jupyter Notebook

Each cell is labeled with the respective graph it represents. The ordering from top to bottom displays:

- Missing Data showcase, 
- Player Kill & Death Counts, 
- Player Score Distributions,
- Headshot Kills vs Kill-Death Count, 
- Scorestreak Kills vs Kill-Death Count, 
- Overall k/dDistributions
- Headshot & Scorestreak Revisited, 
- Player Score vs k/d, 
- Most Common Weapons Used, 
- Top 8 Most Used Weapons Compared, 
- Weapons Exhibiting Similar Distributions, 
- Weapons Displaying Different Trends, 
- Weapon Popularity vs Game Modes, 
- Weapon Popularity vs Specialists.

There are 2 helper methods: one for creating Missing Data plot and the other creating heatmaps for Weapon Popularity vs Specialists and Game Modes.

### Python File:
Like Jupyter Notebook, Python files are also structured from top to bottom, with plots labeled using comments that describe the relationship the plots showcase between labels, starting with: 

- Missing Data showcase, 
- Player Kill & Death Counts, 
- Player Score Distributions,
- Headshot Kills vs Kill-Death Count, 
- Scorestreak Kills vs Kill-Death Count, 
- Overall k/dDistributions
- Headshot & Scorestreak Revisited, 
- Player Score vs k/d, 
- Most Common Weapons Used, 
- Top 8 Most Used Weapons Compared, 
- Weapons Exhibiting Similar Distributions, 
- Weapons Displaying Different Trends, 
- Weapon Popularity vs Game Modes, 
- Weapon Popularity vs Specialists.

Likewise, there are 2 helper methods 1 for creating Missing Data plot and the 2nd creaing heatmaps for Weapon Popularity vs Specialists and Game Modes.


## How to run code:
### Jupyter Notebook:
Code is organized in a way that you can execute `run all` to display the graphs showcasing comparisons and relationships between data and labels.

### Python File:

Executing python file `cod_analysis.py` will display all plots and graphs. Each window popup has title respective to the graph it displays.
